# MacOSTestWebApp
These 100 lines of code get you a website with server-side scripting and database capabilities.

# Prerequisites on MacOS
__None__

Nothing needs to be installed on MacOS. 
We rely on 
- SQLite3
- Python 2.7
- CGIHTTPServer 

All provided out of the box on any MacOS platform.

# Technologies used

- HTML
  - _Maybe CSS later_
- Javascript
  - Fetch API
- Python CGI library
- SQL queries to a SQLite3 database

# Getting started

In the cgi-bin folder update the first line of each file with the right path to Python 2. Use `which python` command in the terminal.
_I will upload a Python 3 version later._

# Warning

There are no web security features in any of these elements. Do __not__ use this in a production environment or under an account that has access to any of you personal data. 
However, if you are using a public account this project requiring no additional installations may be exactly what you need.
